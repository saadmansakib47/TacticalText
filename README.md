### Purpose
This project was part of the course SWE 4302 (Object Oriented Concepts II Lab), where we were told to demonstrate the necessity of [clean codes] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-clean-code/#:~:text=Clean%20code%20is%20written%20in,maintain%2C%20debug%2C%20and%20modify) and [SOLID Principles] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) by refactoring an existing project that was done earlier by the students or anyone else. I chose 'TacticalTextRPG' which was a toy project done early in my undergrad life, when I was not yet aware of the importance of clean codes, object oriented concepts and even proper version controlling. I observed the structure 
of the project and refactored it by applying the principles and concepts we were taught in the course. 

### Details
First, each player will be granted with a budget of 500$. 
Player1 will be prompted to a shop where they can choose the units and number of the units to make their army.

Player 1 and Player2 deploys their units. The battle advances with calculating the attack logic of each units.
